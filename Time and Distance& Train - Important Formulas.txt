Speed, Time and Distance:

Speed =		Distance		,	Time =		Distance		,	Distance = (Speed x Time).
Time	Speed
km/hr to m/sec conversion:

x km/hr =		x x	5/18	m/sec.

m/sec to km/hr conversion:

x m/sec =		x x	18/5		km/hr.

If the ratio of the speeds of A and B is a : b, then the ratio of

the times taken by them to cover the same distance is	1	:	1	or b : a.

Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x km/hr and an equal distance at y km/hr. Then,

the average speed during the whole journey is		2xy/(x + y)		km/hr.

If two trains of length a metres and b metres are moving in opposite directions at u m/s and v m/s, then:

The time taken by the trains to cross each other =	(a + b)/(u + v)	sec.

If two trains of length a metres and b metres are moving in the same direction at u m/s and v m/s, then:

The time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train =	(a + b)/(u - v)	sec.


if two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take a and b sec in reaching B and A respectively, then:

(A's speed) : (B's speed) = (b^1/2 : a^1/2)
